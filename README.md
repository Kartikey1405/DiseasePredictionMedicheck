# AI-Symptom-Checker
Overview
The AI-Powered Symptom Checker is a web application designed to analyze user-reported symptoms and provide potential disease predictions along with recommendations for further action. By leveraging K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithms, this tool aims to enhance health literacy, improve user experience, and promote timely healthcare interventions.
